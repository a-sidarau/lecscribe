 One goose in podcast chair, backwards cap, giant mic. Chart that's just a circle labeled bread. But other geese nod, other geese clap. Other geese say, wow, this goose smart. Why? Because goose speak with confidence. Use big words, speak fast. Say studies show even if no study. Just vibes, that's the scam. Fake expert doesn't need facts, just needs head tilt, firm voice. And a platform. Real expert says, I don't know. Says, it's complicated, very unsexy, very unviral. So guess who gets the views? The clout, the speaking tour at PongCon. Podcasting goose. And deep down, some geese like it. Because certainty feels better than truth. And confidence feels like safety, even when it's wrong. Final goose wisdom. Don't trust goose, just because they honk loud. Ask what's behind the chart. If it's just breadcrumbs, walk away. Like, honk, subscribe.
